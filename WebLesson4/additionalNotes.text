SQL injection:
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE (username = 'hacker') AND (password='1' OR '1'='1');

Race Conditions:
  two users try to modify or access a database at the same time,
  and SQL commands get executed in an unexpected order.

  Example:
    SELECT balance FROM bank WHERE user_id = 1;
    UPDATE bank SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE user_id = 1;

  Solution: Use Transaction (lock the database when running a transaction)
    BEGIN;
    /* SQL commands */
    COMMIT;
